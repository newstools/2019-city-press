They are Gideon Mendel, Robin Rhode and Alexia Webster. Over the years the Prix Pictet screening has become an important part of the opening week of the festival, which is a world photography leader. The short list features work by 12 artists from eight countries across four continents. The other artists shortlisted are Shahidul Alam (Bangladesh), Joana Choumali (Ivory Coast), Margaret Courtney-Clarke (Namibia), Rena Effendi (Azerbaijan), Lucas Foglia (US), Janelle Lynch (US), Ross McDonnell (Ireland), Ivor Prickett (Ireland) and Awoiska van der Molen (Netherlands). The theme for the competition this year was Hope, which the festival defined as: “Hope in the face of adversity. Recycling. Reforestation. Rewilding. Science – advances in medicine – and technological solutions for global environmental problems. Falling poverty levels. “It is time to examine some of the positive actions on sustainability that are beginning to emerge by contrast with the alarming analysis that constantly assails us in the global media.
