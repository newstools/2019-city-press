Parliamentary portfolio committees have finally decided to move with the times, after many years of not being active on social media and have joined Twitter. A total of 43 parliamentary portfolios and select committees have opened Twitter accounts “to enable members of the public to participate in the business of the committees,” said Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mathapo. House chairperson of committees Cedric Frolick and Jomo Nyambi echoed Mathapo’s sentiments, saying in a joint statement that the Twitter accounts would enable members of the public to participate in the business of the committees by responding to invitations for public comments, in writing, for bills or any matters before the committees. They added that: “The accounts can also be used to make representations or recommendations to the committees on bills or any other matters before the committees.” Mathapo said in a statement that taking to social media in this manner was also an attempt to reach young citizens. “It sees social media platforms as tools to encourage dialogue between citizens and parliamentarians with the “potential to foster greater respect for democracy and democratic institutions while promoting participation and greater accountability,” Mothapo said. Mothapo said that Parliament made this decision to open access to its business and involve all citizens in the formulation of legislation. It would also enable Parliament to exercise better oversight on the executive.
