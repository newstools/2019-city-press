Embattled eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede’s special leave has been extended for a further two weeks as a result of the Kwa-Zulu Natal ANC executive committee having not reached a decision over when she can return to work. This despite her special leave ending on Wednesday. The committee expressed that it was still in the process of seeking a resolution to the mayor’s investigation “We expect the comrades affected to remain on leave and to wait for the organisation to complete a process they are familiar with in the way of their participation in the same process,” said ANC provincial secretary-general Mdumiseni Ntuli. On Wednesday, Ntuli told journalists that Gumede’s special leave would be extended until the party resolves the investigation. This will, according to Ntuli, happen at the next committee meeting which is expected to take place in two weeks’ time.

That work is almost complete, it will be processed by the next meeting of the provincial working committee,” Ntuli said. Gumede is facing charges of fraud and corruption relating to R208 million spent in a Durban Solid Waste tender in 2016. She was placed on special leave last month while the provincial committee’s task team investigates the allegations against her and the other accused.

Gumede and Mthembu are facing charges of money laundering, corruption and racketeering. The mayor’s woes still continued even when she was on special leave, as her supporters were accused of using municipal buses when they embarked on a protest calling for Gumede to be reinstated.
