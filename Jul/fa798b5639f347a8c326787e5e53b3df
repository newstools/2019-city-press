British Airways yesterday suspended flights to Cairo for seven days to allow for an assessment of security there, the airline said. However, it gave no details about what had prompted the move. “We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world, and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment,” the airline said. It added that it would not operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so. When asked for more details about why flights had been suspended and what security arrangements the airline was reviewing, a spokesperson for the airline responded: “We never discuss matters of security.” Three Egyptian airport security sources said that British staff were checking security at Cairo International Airport on Wednesday and Thursday. They provided no further details. The British foreign office advises against all but essential travel by air to and from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, but has not issued similar warnings against air travel to and from Cairo. The Egypt State Information Service could not immediately be reached for comment.
