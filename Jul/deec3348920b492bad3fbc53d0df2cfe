Former president Jacob Zuma’s testimony before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture has come to an abrupt end after he and his legal team expressed concerns over the manner in which he was being questioned. Representing the former president, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane requested a short adjournment to “consult and reflect on” how his client should proceed going forward. After Zuma raised concerns over “being cross-examined” and not being required to provide his own version of events, Sikhakhane intervened and accused the commission of hauling his client before it “under false pretenses”. “I believe my client was brought before this commission under false pretenses and I am now reevaluating my decision of having advised him to come here since it has become clear to me that he is being cross-examined,” said Sikhakhane. Following the request for a short adjournment, commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo announced that the two legal teams representing Zuma and the commission, respectively, had agreed on an adjournment until Friday. “What has been agreed upon is that there should be an opportunity between both legal teams to look for a way in which they can address Zuma’s concerns without the commission’s legal team compromising their obligations.” Zondo said he was “confident” that there were “reasonable prospects that a way would be found to make sure that proceedings would resume” on Friday.
