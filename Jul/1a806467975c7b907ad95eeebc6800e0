The ANC has expressed deep disappointment in “the blatant belittling” and “misogyny” over comments made by United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa when he referred to ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte as “tea girl”. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the comments had left a bad taste in the ANC’s mouth particularly because they were expressed just as the country is about to celebrate Women’s Month. “As we are about to mark the beginning of Women’s Month tomorrow, we call on all progressive men in the UDM to distance themselves from Mr Holomisa’s misogynistic tendencies. He must be condemned by all South Africans who are committed to uprooting the demon of sexism and the oppression of women from our society,” the ANC said in a statement. Holomisa took to Twitter on Tuesday evening and lambasted Duarte. “Thank her for the compliment, however, I must correct you, the PA to Madiba was Ambassador Barbara Masekela. Jessie used to serve us tea at Shell House hence they call her Tea –Girl,” Holomisa said.  He uttered this after Duarte allegedly called him a dictator on a documentary that played on SABC1. The governing party labelled Holomisa’s comment as “blatant contempt” and “belittling of women” which has no place in a non-sexist and democratic society which frowns upon misogyny and all its manifestations. The party also went on to say that Duarte was an esteemed member of the party who had made a considerable contribution towards the liberation struggle. “Throughout its history, women have been playing a central role in the life of the African National Congress. From Charlotte Maxeke, Lillian Ngoyi, Ruth Mompati, Winnie Mandela to the current generation, women activists have led heroic struggle against racial, class and gender oppression.” Mabe said the persistence of misogynistic tendencies threatened to reverse and derail the national efforts to promote women empowerment and gender equality.
