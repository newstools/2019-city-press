The book is an anthology of poems and writings about former ANC president and anti-apartheid activist Oliver Reginald Tambo, and two of the men with whom he shared a special relationship and bond: Sweden’s former prime minister Olof Palme and former president Thabo Mbeki.  The launch was marked by two events, starting with the reading of poetry from Mabuza’s book in the UK Parliament’s House of Lords. This occasion was hosted by South African-born British peer and well-known anti-apartheid activist Lord Peter Hain, who remains a good friend of South Africa. He has made headlines in the recent past for speaking out against the Guptas and corruption in the then Jacob Zuma-led administration.  Expressing his joy at the response, Masote, a former member of the SA National Youth Orchestra, said that the highlight for him was not only his performance, but also learning more about his country: “Performing in front of the high commissioner was a privilege and a great pleasure,” he said.  “Listening to the stories gave me more of a sense of responsibility as a young South African. It’s great to see that politicians and government officials are noticing our talent as young people. I will always cherish this.”  And his father is celebrated cellist and musical conductor Kutlwano Masote.  Also part of the line-up on Wednesday evening was Durban-born and now London-based Njabulo Madlala, a baritone who trained at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and at the Cardiff International Academy of Voice.
