South Africa have finally emerged from the suspense of the past 26-hours, waiting to know their fate at Afcon, and Bafana Bafana are ready to face hosts Egypt on Saturday. Defender Sifiso Hlanti said the players have respect for Mo Salah and the Pharaohs but don’t fear them. “There is nothing we are afraid of. We also have good players,” said the Bidvest Wits defender.

So we are not going to give them that respect. I have a feeling that we can make things happen, not only for us but for the county – they have been waiting for something to happen. “I know some people are rating us nowhere but we are confident that we can turn things around.” The Egyptian team finished the group stage unbeaten and are yet to concede a goal in the tournament so far.

But Hlanti is not intimidated. “It’s a learning curve to play against players who are playing in Europe. That’s what I’m always looking forward to, to compete with the best. “I won’t put pressure on myself, but I’m not afraid of anyone.” Bafana progressed with three points as one of the qualifying best ranked third-place finishers across the six Afcon groups. On Saturday, it will be the Pharaohs who will be under pressure as Salah and his teammates carry the hopes of about 100 million Egyptians. The game at the majestic Cairo International Stadium kicks off at 9pm.
