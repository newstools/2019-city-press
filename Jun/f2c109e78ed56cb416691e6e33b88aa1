Former KPMG South Africa chief executive Nhlamu Dlomu has been appointed as the company’s new “Global Head of People”. Dlomu’s appointment – which comes into effect on July 8 – was announced by KPMG South Africa chairperson Wiseman Nkuhlu in an internal statement on Friday afternoon. “I’m delighted to announce that our global chairman, Bill Thomas has appointed Nhlamu Dlomu as the new global head of people,” Nkuhlu said. Her new role effectively makes her the human resource boss for KPMG globally. Following KPMG’s job cuts and lost business over work done for a company owned by the Gupta family last year, the firm announced that Dlomu - who was the chief executive at the time - would step down to allow a new leader to restore the auditor’s reputation after the scandal that saw the company lose several major clients.

The firm subsequently announced that the new person to lead the company would be recruited internally and this saw Ignatius Sehoole take over the reins in an effort to restore the KPMG’s battered reputation at the time. This allowed Dlomu to take up a “global role” at KPMG in February this year. “Prior to being the CEO of KPMG South Africa, many of you would remember that Nhlamu was head of people in the firm, and more recently, the head of global culture and organisational development,” Nkuhlu said. The KPMG chairman added that Dlomu’s expertise prior and during her chief executive days would prove invaluable to her current position. He said: “I have no doubt that Nhlamu’s leadership experience as well as human resources and change management expertise will prove invaluable to drive the global collective strategy forward.” “Nhlamu will be relocating to London and will join the global chairman’s executive committee.”
