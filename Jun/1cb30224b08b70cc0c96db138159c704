Business Unity South Africa (Busa) chief executive officer Tanya Cohen has resigned from the organisation, two-and-a-half years into the job and half a year shy of the completion of her contract at the business lobby group. Busa issued a statement on Monday morning announcing the departure of Cohen, which also states that the decision was taken after consultation with the board. “I have accomplished what I set out to do: reposition Busa as South Africa’s apex business organisation and a credible, strategic and critical partner to government and other social partners at Nedlac.  So, this was an opportune time to bow out. I wish the board and the organisation well as they navigate the new dawn for the benefit of all South Africans,” Cohen sai. The Busa board also said Cohen was an exceptionally capable leader who, during her tenure, had managed to reposition the organisation and build strategic relationships with government, organised labour and community. The statement also listed a number of milestones achieved under Cohen’s leadership. “Cohen’s notable achievements at Busa include hosting the inaugural Busa Business Economic Indaba, positioning Busa on policy game-changers such as the future of work, health, land, energy, the national minimum wage and labour relations stability agreements, and the jobs summit framework agreement, steering the rebranding of Busa; and significantly growing Busa’s membership and capacity both internally and externally as well as helping develop the first overarching policy position by business on transformation,”the statement read. It also said the board would finalise Cohen’s interim replacement with a week.
