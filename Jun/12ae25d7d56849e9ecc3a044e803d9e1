Sunday Times investigative reporter Qaanitah Hunter was on Saturday night awarded the prestigious Nat Nakasa Award for courageous journalism and integrity at the SA National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) annual general meeting in Johannesburg. Hunter was recognised for her work in highlighting mental illness in journalism. She was nominated among a formidable field of journalists that included Pieter-Louis Myburgh, Robert Marawa, Pauli van Wyk and Ranjeni Munusamy. Sanef chair Mahlatse Mahlase said: “Despite the trying times facing journalists, this is the time to be brave. This is the time to find the Nat Nakasa within us.” Nakasa was a South African journalist who died at the age of 28 in 1965 – he was in exile after writing against the apartheid state. Delivering the keynote speech, Advocate Hermione Cronje of the National Prosecuting Authority commended the critical role the media has played in exposing corruption and upholding democracy in South Africa.
