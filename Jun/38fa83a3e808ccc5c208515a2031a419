To celebrate Africa Month, The Market theatre in Johannesburg presented a contemporary dance double bill called Legaga/Mnquma, which unpacked the dynamics of African identity through South African eyes. Mnquma, choreographed by Xolisile Bongwana and David April, and  Legaga, choreographed by Teresa Phuti Mojela, crafted a beautiful and spiritually profound dialogue with one another. In Mnquma, Bongwana explored his personal totems to find a connection to his roots and his ancestry, while April unpacked his own roots within Tswana dance forms.  The piece makes it clear that it is only by knowing the past and the depth of our cultural riches and rituals that Africans can shape the future. Legaga is described as an exploration of memory, dreams and nightmares told through movement, song and text.  Inspired by Mojela’s personal journey as a performer and an African woman, Legaga took the audience on a journey from childhood to adulthood – rites of passage, hardships, joys, fears, rejections and tragedies.  Photographer Rosetta Msimango photographed this memorable production.
