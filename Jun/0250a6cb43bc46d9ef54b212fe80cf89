An affiliate of the Danisa Baloyi (BBC), the National Black Business Caucus (NBBC), has penned a scathing letter to the BBC accusing it of passing the buck. This comes after the BBC asked the NBBC to punish former BBC president Danisa Baloyi. NBBC president Dupree Vilakazi confirmed to City Press that the organisation had sent the letter to BBC secretary-general Judy Nokwedi, after the NBBC was asked last month to discipline Baloyi for allegedly bringing the organisation into disrepute. However, according to Vilakazi the BBC request was short on detail and did not specify why Baloyi should be disciplined. “They want us to act against Danisa but [we] are not clear what exactly she did to us so that we [can] punish her. If it is a legal matter that is sub judice then why should we let [not] that process take its course,” Vilakazi said, adding that he also wanted clarity on what action his organisation should take as the BBC had already sanctioned Baloyi. Vilakazi said the BBC was attempting to pass the buck to the NBBC. The NBBC was asked by the BBC to take action against Baloyi after it started a disciplinary process against her more than a year ago. Baloyi and three co-accused are facing criminal charges for their alleged part in a multimillion rand donation from the Airports Company SA (Acsa) which was not paid to the BBC. She will appear again in court early next month. Questions sent to the BBC president Sandile Zungu as well as chief executive Kganki Matabane were acknowledged but not responded to. The organisation was scheduled to hold a council meeting earlier this week but it was postponed. Instead a two-day strategic workshop for the national office bearers only was held.
