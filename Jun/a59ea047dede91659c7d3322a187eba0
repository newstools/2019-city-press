Former Minister of Women in the Presidency and current ANC Women’s League president, Bathabile Dlamini, is the latest to throw in the towel as a member of Parliament. Dlamini’s resignation as an MP was announced on Tuesday morning by a tweet from the ANC’s official parliamentary account, after she failed to make the cut as a minister in Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet following the May 2019 general elections. “The office of the [Chief Whip] confirms the resignation of former minister of women in the Presidency comrade Bathabile Dlamini as an ANC Member of Parliament,” the tweet from the verified @ANCParliament account said.  Dlamini joins Thokozile Xasa, Dipou Letsatsi-Duba, Makhosini Nkosi and Nomaindia Mfeketo who also resigned as members of the National Assembly. On Monday former ministers Siyabonga Cwele and Jeff Radebe also handed in their resignation letters. In March Dlamini was strongly critisised after ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule confirmed that she, along with Nomvula Mokonyane, Mosebenzi Zwane and Malusi Gigaba, had been selected by the party for its national and provincial lists. They had all been embroiled in allegations of corruption and impropriety. Read: ‘You want us to remove people because of allegations?’ – ANC reveals controversial list
