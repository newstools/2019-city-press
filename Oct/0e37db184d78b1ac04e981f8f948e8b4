Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to deliver the medium-term budget speech on Wednesday. The country is expecting a concerted effort from the minister to addressing the high unemployment levels in the country. According to marketing and social research consultancy Citizens Survey: “South Africans are concerned about Eskom and unemployment, and therefore it is likely that Mboweni will address this in his speech.” The power utility started implementing stage two load shedding recently, as a result of “shortage of capacity”.
