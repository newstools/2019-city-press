Just 10 minutes into a hard-hitting interview on Al Jazeera and former National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete fielded questions around corruption, the controversial Nkandla upgrades, the case which was brought against her by the DA for failing to fulfil her constitutional obligations as the speaker when Jacob Zuma was president and the time she referred to EFF leader Julius Malema as a “cockroach”. Mbete, who was being interviewed by Head to Head host Mehdi Hasan on the state of South Africa and whether or not the ANC had betrayed Nelson Mandela’s legacy, seemed to deflect questions that were posed to her by Hasan, which sparked outrage at the way in which she handled the interview. “So what?” is what Mbete shot back at Hasan when he referred to a United Nations report concluding that South Africa has the fifth highest rate of murder in the world. “So what? Well then there you go,” a bewildered Hasan retorted. Mbete was joined by former ANC Members of Parliament Makhosi Khoza and Andrew Feinstein on the panel. The former deputy president and ANC chairperson was asked by Hasan about South Africa being rated as the most unequal country in the world by the World Bank, to which she emphatically responded that the World Bank was “not God”. “But I wonder whether it’s not an exaggeration. I really think we need to see both good and bad. The World Bank is not God.” South Africans took to social media and referred to Mbete as “embarrassing”, with some questioning who sanctioned her to be on the show to begin with.
