EFF Mpumalanga chairperson Collen Sedibe has been captured on video boasting about being the reason why EFF national chairperson Dali Mpofu could be replaced by EFF MP Veronica Mente in the elective conference in December. Sunday World reported that Mpofu’s “busy schedule” was being used as the reason to lobby that he not be returned as national chairperson when the party holds its elective conference at the end of the year.

Sedibe is seen on a video saying that Mpofu won a number of cases for ANC people in court, but was unable to do the same for EFF, because “if he represented the EFF, it would be conflict of interest”. Sedibe added that “that makes us suffer to lose cases”. “For example, the reason Supra Mahumapelo won a case in the North West is Dali. The reason the faction of Senzo Mchunu won in KZN is Dali. Free State is Dali. All the ANC battles is Dali that won them. But by law he can’t represent the EFF,” argued Sedibe. He mentioned this in a branch meeting, during a selection of delegates meeting in Mpumalanga that will represent the province in the elective conference in December. On the video Sedibe admits to suggesting that the position be taken from Mpofu and given to Mente. He said Mpofu was asked in a “good spirit” to down as his “services are requested outside the party”. “We request the chairperson to step down, his services are requested outside. We met with him and agreed with him, but anyway it was me who suggested the name of MP Veronica Mente,” said Sedibe, to applause from the meeting. Sedibe made reference to the case Mpofu won for former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo against the ruling to overturn the ANC national executive committee’s decision to disband his provincial executive committee.
