South Africans reacted with sadness and shock as the news of the death of actor Andile Gumbi (36) filtered across the country. Messages of condolences flooded social media platforms as fans expressed their shock at the death of “such a young and talented actor.” Gumbi was well known for his roles as Zweli Ntshangase on Isibaya and as the adult Simba in The Lion King Production.   He died today after suffering a heart attack last week while working on a theatre production – Daniel The Musical – in Israel. The production team released a statement after Gumbi – a model, dancer and actor – fell ill initially. “In the early morning he deteriorated and suffered a cardiac arrest, but the medical personnel at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre managed to successfully resuscitate him. His present condition is critical,” read the statement. “It is comforting to know that Andile is receiving the best medical care in the world as he is fighting for his life and the medical professionals are trying to determine the cause of his condition. We ask that people pray for his speedy and full recovery.” It was reported that his wife Hlengiwe had flown to Israel to be by his side while he was recovering from the heart attack. Gumbi played the lead role of King Nebuchadnezzar in the production of Daniel the Musical. In a statement on Friday, Mzansi Magic’s Karabo Maroga, said they were saddened by Gumbi’s passing. “As Mzansi Magic, we are saddened by the passing of our former Isibaya actor Andile Gumbi. Andile was very talented with lots still to offer to the entertainment industry. Our deepest condolences to his family and friends. He will be greatly missed,” she said.
