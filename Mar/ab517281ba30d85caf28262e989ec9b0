ANC leader Jackson Mthembu’s eldest daughter, Khwezi Mthembu, took her own life on Tuesday evening. This is according to the chief whip, who on Wednesday morning tweeted out the tragic news. He said that he and his family were in “deep pain”.  A string of condolence messages began pouring in, including those from the leader of newly formed political party, the African Transformation Movement’s (ATM) Mzwanele Manyi, the EFF’s Godrich Gardee and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.    Although the details surrounding the death of Khwezi are unknown at this stage, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported last year that South Africa has the sixth highest rate of suicide in the world. WHO also indicated that 800 000 people died as a result of suicide each year, and that it is the second leading cause of death in the world’s population, aged between 15 and 29 years old. In 2017, Africa Check said that suicide was the fourth leading cause of death for young people aged between 15 and 24 in South Africa in 2012. That year, 1 665 young people died as a result of suicide.
