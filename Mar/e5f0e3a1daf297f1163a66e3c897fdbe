Transnet has placed four of its executives on precautionary suspension as the rail operator continues with multiple investigations into corruption and maladministration. The four are group human resource officer, Nonkululeko Sishi, group chief operating officer, Mlamuli Buthelezi, chief executive for Transnet Freight Rail, Ravi Nair and chief executive: Transnet National Port Authority, Shulami Qalinge. Acting Group Chief Executive Tau Morwe wrote in a staff memorandum that Transnet was a business in transition, with their primary aim being to restore confidence and deliver on their mandate. “We therefore need to be deliberate on improving our corporate governance and establish leadership (informed by principles of integrity and accountability). The journey also involves taking difficult decisions with the view to restoring confidence on Transnet. To this end, four of our Executive Committee members have been suspended, effective today,” he said. Morwe wrote that “Transnet is of the view that their continued presence in the workplace has the potential to jeopardize investigations into their alleged misconduct. Given the positions they occupy it is almost impossible to investigate the allegations while they are at work. It is in the best interest of Transnet that they be placed on suspension on full pay with full benefits.”
