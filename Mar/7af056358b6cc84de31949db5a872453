Former ANC MP and parliamentary caucus chairperson Vytjie Mentor will not be voting ANC in the upcoming May 8 elections. Mentor – who testified before the state capture commission last year and said that she had been offered the public enterprises minister position by the Gupta family – made the announcement on her Facebook account on Thursday morning. “I am not voting ANC,” read her post. This was followed by yet another post in which Mentor appealed to South Africans to join her in not voting for the ruling party. “South Africans will show the ANC flames in this election. I will be announcing the party I will be voting for very soon. If you truly love this country, don’t vote ANC,” she said. She did not give reasons to why she has taken this position; however, a quick browse through her Facebook page portrays an individual who has lost all hope of the ruling party’s ability to deliver for ordinary South Africans. Messages such as “ANC looters flaunt their stolen wealth and become the aspirational focus of the youth thus breeding clones at an alarming pace” are plastered on her timeline. This utterance comes just a day after former ANC MP Hlengiwe Mgabadeli – who Mentor had claimed to have spoken to about the Guptas offering her a job – testified before the Zondo commission and said she “did not recall having such a conversation with Ms Mentor”. Mgabadeli said she learnt about the details of Mentor’s encounter with the Guptas after watching it on television. This was yet another blow to Mentor’s testimony following the failure by the state capture commission’s investigations team to corroborate the former MP’s submissions.
