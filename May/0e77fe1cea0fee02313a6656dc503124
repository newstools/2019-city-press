Two of the top 10 parties who led the voting on Thursday morning included newcomers Good, led by former DA mayor in the Western Cape Patricia de Lille and the African Transformation Movement (ATM) led by Vuyolwethu Zungula. By 10.35am on Thursday morning 4 074 058 votes had been counted in the country’s sixth general elections, with the ANC maintaining a national lead with a 54.85 % support. A total of 7 046 voting districts had been counted, and according to the IEC results which were trickling in, all but one province, the DA-led Western Cape, had the ANC as the front runner. In the Western Cape the DA maintained its lead with 524 348 votes being cast for the party. Provincially, in the North West and Northern Cape, the EFF’s support was growing, with 45 131 and 26 844 votes cast in support of the EFF in each province respectively. Counting in the Northern Cape was more than 80% complete. Good in the Western Cape were sitting in third spot with 3.14% marginally ahead of the EFF at 3.06%, this after 56% of the vote was counted. The ATM features prominently in Eastern Cape and the Free State where they  have amassed 1.3% and 0.65% of the vote respectively to sit fifth in both provinces. However, both provinces still have an ANC stronghold of over 60% support, yet 50% of the vote had not been counted yet. The total voting districts that had been counted at this stage was 30.74%. Final results are expected to be released on Saturday.
