There have been murmurs subsequent to the Democratic Alliance’s poor showing in this week’s polls that some within the party were plotting their leader Mmusi Maimane’s swift exit. The DA leader, however, on Friday came out swinging and staked his claim on the party’s leadership saying he is still the best option to take the party forward. “It’s really about the 2021 municipal elections and the 2024 national and provincial elections now,” said Maimane, who added that under his leadership the DA had “remained true to its mandate”. “In a universe where so many in the world will resort to racial nationalism and populism we have stayed true to the DA ideals where black people, white people, Indian people and coloured people can work together to realise the dreams of a prosperous nation,” Maimane said. The DA leader acknowledged that the party had in these recent polls lost some of its previously loyal voters, particularly to the “more right wing” Freedom Front Plus, but said the party would not be changing its stance on “building a South Africa inclusive for all”. “This is a historic mission that this party has been engaged in and I am proud to continue and will continue with,” said the resolute Maimane. He said he had run his race, however, it was still not over as he now had his eyes firmly set on the 2021 municipal elections and the 2024 national and provincial elections. Maimane thanked all those who voted for the DA and assured them that “apart from retaining the Western Cape, the party is also challenging to wrestle back Nelson Mandela Bay while Gauteng is still on a knife’s edge.” The DA’s Athol Trollip, who accompanied Maimane to the media briefing held at the IEC’s results operations center in Tshwane, also reiterated that Maimane was to remain the leader of the party “until the next elections”.
