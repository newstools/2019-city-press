Deputy President David Mabuza will not be sworn in on Wednesday as a member of the National Assembly. According to a statement issued by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Mabuza requested that his swearing-in be postponed until he is able to clear his name with the ANC Integrity Commission — which flagged him among party members who needed to account before it. ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe and 20 others have also been flagged. "The deputy president made the request in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute,” Ramaphosa said.
