David “DD” Mabuza is set to resume his Parliamentary duties as deputy president of the ANC following his swearing-in ceremony that took place in Pretoria on Tuesday. Mabuza, who many refer to as “The Cat”, will finally take his seat as President Cyril Ramaphosa’s right-hand man. Mabuza postponed his swearing-in as a member of Parliament on Wednesday, choosing to rather face the party’s integrity committee and “clear his name” first. On Sunday, City Press reported how Mabuza cited the need to first clear his name with the commission which he has since done. READ: ‘Betrayed and angry’, but Mabuza’s back in the running as No. 2 Mabuza’s actions came after the commission had his name on a list of 22 people identified for conduct that might have brought the party into disrepute. In its report, the integrity commission had raised the question of credibility and harming the reputation of the ANC as the main reasons it recommended controversial candidates, including Mabuza, to be removed from the ANC list of election candidates.  On Friday, the committee presented Mabuza with reasons why his name had been flagged as a reputational risk to the ANC – including allegations circulating in the media. At his swearing in, administered by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, Mabuza took his oath which included him promising to uphold the Constitution and being faithful to the republic. Mabuza was subsequently joined by Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise and Ramaphosa, who jokingly said to Mabuza: “Sesiphelele Manje (We are complete now).” However it is still unclear whether Mabuza will remain as the deputy president of the republic.
