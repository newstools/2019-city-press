Many of its employees were left jobless with some dying poor without seeing a cent of their pensions packages. “Most people died bitter and poor. It is not only the bus company that was shut down but a lot of factories where our brothers and sisters used to work were closed down by this government,” said Tladi. He suffers from arthritis and uses a walking stick when he has to walk long distances. Though he was disappointed with the ANC government he believed that current party leader President Cyril Ramaphosa would turn things around. However, he was not prepared to give all his support to one party and decided to split his votes into two on Wednesday when he made his mark. “I want change. I am tired of hearing that things are on the pipeline. I hope this vote will bring that change we are so yearning for. I voted for the ANC, which I have always done, but I voted for them only nationally. I don’t have a problem with Ramaphosa. He is alright. “But provincially I decided to vote for another party. Then in the province I said I must give a chance to the young man, Julius Malema. I always hear him speak in Parliament and I think he is a man of his word,” said Tladi.
