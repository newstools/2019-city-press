Train to Tembisa is a project that talks about my daily journey from home in Tembisa to school in Johannesburg – my experiences in this giant snake that carries thousands of people from different places. I look at how the space is being used by young and old; and how people act within this mode of transport, which gets very overcrowded, yet they still find ways of distracting themselves and keeping their journey interesting. In this project, I also look at the emotions of the commuters and how they interact with the environment. There is not a dull moment in the train as people do different things to enjoy their journey – some take risks by surfing; others play cards and have interesting conversations to pass time. Within these packed trains, people find ways to distance themselves from the “crowdedness” and others wait patiently to get to their destinations in one piece.
