“We now know what our weakness are. We know our mistakes and we are sorry” and this makes us the right party to take South Africa forward. Those were the words from President Cyril Ramaphosa after casting his vote at Hitekani Primary School in Chiawelo, Soweto. “Much as we have done a lot over the past 25 years to reduce the ravages of poverty, inequality still remains and unemployment is high because we deviated from the mandate we were given by South Africans since they put us in power.” He went on to urge his party to now “return to addressing the plight of poor people in the country”. “We must hasten service delivery. I am saying I don’t want any further excuses, I just want to get to work at implementing our policies and doing what is right by our people,” said Ramaphosa.

As much as we have made mistakes, we have also been doing quiet a lot. We have made mistakes. We are sorry about those mistakes and we are saying our people should reinvest their confidence in us because now we know where we have gone wrong.” The commissions of inquiry that are going on are revealing a lot, he said. “Now we are owning up to that and saying we are going to correct our bad ways of the past,” promised Ramaphosa. He added that after all the commissions make their recommendations, the ANC would take them seriously and would follow up. “What we are saying is that never again should South Africa go though what it has gone through.” Ramaphosa was accompanied by the ANC’s Zizi Kodwa, who also cast his vote at this polling station. Kodwa said he woke up early with his “sweetheart to vote” after a call from Ramaphosa that “all comrades and their loved ones should go out in their numbers to vote”.
