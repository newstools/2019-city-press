The voters are saying “goodbye” to the ANC and the writing is on the wall, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu said after casting his vote on Wednesday morning at Moses Kotane Primary School in Braamfischer in Soweto. He managed to enter the station quietly without drawing the attention of the media contingent waiting outside, and only gave interviews afterwards. Shivambu said his observation was inspired by the voter turnout at the station, comparing it to the first democratic elections in 1994 and adding that in previous polls it had not been the same. “When a change of government is happening the people come out in their numbers, so the people are here to change government. “All these people who are queuing are here to change government and these are the people that when the results are counted you will realise they are saying that the ANC must be removed from office”.  He said the EFF was confident that “there would not be an outright winner at national level, and definitely we are to defeat the ANC here in Gauteng. So, these people are saying goodbye to the ANC, he said He said the second biggest opposition’s target and approach at the moment was to win the elections and therefore coalitions were not an option.  “Of course [Julius Malema] would be president. That is what we are going to do then we will take the leadership of EFF and other capable people and give them strategic ministries.” Shivambu said the story of the 2019 elections would be about “the tremendous growth and meteoric rise of the EFF”. “A lot of people thought the EFF would not survive past the first or second elections, but the growth of the EFF now will basically be saying that we are going to be in charge of the government.” So, economic freedom is coming because of the EFF, he said.
