Nomvula Mokonyane has joined the list of ANC members withdrawing from Parliament, citing family responsibilities as her reason. News of her withdrawal came hot on the heels of the announcement that Deputy President David Mabuza would not be sworn in as a member of Parliament this morning. Mokonyane had this week been named as the replacement to House chairperson Cedric Frolick. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule confirmed this morning that Mokonyane’s name had been withdrawn. “The ANC is in receipt of a request by Comrade Nomvula Mokonyane to reconsider her deployment to the sixth Parliament as House chairperson,” he said. The deployment was announced on Monday. “Comrade Nomvula has since advised the ANC that due to family responsibilities and her being in mourning currently, she believes she would be unable to diligently and with commitment, fulfil her duties at this stage,” said Magashule. The ANC will in due course redetermine the deployment of a replacement to the position of House chairperson. Mokonyane, who has served as environmental affairs minister, water minister and minister of communications, has been implicated in multiple graft allegations.
