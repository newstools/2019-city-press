Former Black Business Council (BBC) President Danisa Baloyi and three co-accused were granted bail of R5000 each when they appeared at the Palm Ridge Commercial Crimes Court on charges of fraud and money laundering on Wednesday. Baloyi, businesswoman Hawa Khan, Abubaker Khan as well as businessman Dominic Ntsele appeared jointly on theft charges related to a R5,7 million donation from Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) that was meant for the BBC but never found its way to the council in 2017. According to the charge sheet, which City Press has seen, the four are accused of committing the offence with a common purpose. The document details how two payments of R2850 000 were made by Acsa to Merit Energy, whose directors are the Khan's, with the first payment made on April 25 2017 and the second on May 31 2017. The sole signatory, the document states, of Merit Energy’s Habib Overseas Bank account to which the amounts were transferred was Abubaker Khan. However, an amount of R1 425 000 was transferred from Merit Energy seven days after the first payment was made to Incentive Driven Market’s FNB account. Ntsele is a director of Incentive Driven Market. “The State will allege that the four accused committed the offences in the execution of a common purpose. It is at present unknown to the State precisely when, where and in what circumstances the said common purpose existed, at the very least, immediately prior to the commission of the offences and continued for the duration of the commission of the offences,” the documents reads. Baloyi was suspended for the remainder of her term as BBC president after City Press broke the news of the multimillion Rand donation in 2017. She is still facing an internal disciplinary process and a subcommittee headed by Buhle Mthethwa has been assigned to deal with the matter. Gauteng National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Louw said the four would appear again before the court on July 3.
