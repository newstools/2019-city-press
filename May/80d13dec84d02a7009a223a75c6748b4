Every Sunday the Tsonga cultural groups, Kindlimuka from Freedom Park and Vukani Vatsonga from Chiawelo, gather to sing and dance in different parts of Gauteng. Photographer Rosetta Msimango catches up with them in Chiawelo.  Dressed in colourful traditional clothing called tinguvu or xibelani, as well as animal skins, Tsonga groups dance to Xitsonga music as they entertain revellers in different parts of Johannesburg. There are about 12 different dance groups that participate in the event as they get together to dance and sing in various places around the city – from Soweto and Freedom Park to Alex and Tembisa – to promote the Xitsonga dance and music called gaza. The groups compete among themselves and the spectators throw money at them in appreciation of their good moves and voices. During their meetings, when they contribute to and raise funds for different business ventures, as well as to preserve their traditions, the groups entertain through makwaya (the men’s dance) and xibelani (the women’s dance). Many people flock to these meetings for free entertainment and to unwind. The events are so popular that people fight for the best viewing spots.
