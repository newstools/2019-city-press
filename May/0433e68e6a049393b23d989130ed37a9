The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has issued a warning to the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) just days before the elections on Wednesday, urging the commission to be wary of hackers and cyberattacks. “We have heard scary stories of how elections in other countries were rigged through the sophisticated hacking of results. We hope that the IT companies the IEC has appointed will not fall into this trap. If such a thing should happen, the IEC’s independence will mean nothing and our elections would hold no value,” said UDM leader Bantu Holomisa. Election meddling has risen to the fore following the Russian government’s alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election with the goal of harming the campaign of Hillary Clinton, boosting the candidacy of Donald Trump, and increasing political or social discord in the US. To avert any interference in the looming elections, Holomisa also encouraged other political parties to keep a close eye on how the IEC conducted its business during the elections. “We also call on our colleagues in other political parties to watch the IEC like hawks. Our voting agents should make arrangements to rotate so that we can always have fresh eyes on the voting processes. “We must be especially vigilant when it comes to the marking of the voters roll, to ensure that crooks don’t cast more than one vote,” said the UDM leader. Holomisa was addressing his supporters as part of his party’s last election campaign drive at the Khutsong Stadium in Carletonville in Gauteng’s West Rand yesterday.
