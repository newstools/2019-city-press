The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in Mpumalanga has removed four officials at various voting stations following suspected irregularities. These incidents, which happened in Ermelo and Dr JS Moroka, are just a few blots in an election day that generally ran very smoothly in the province. The IEC is still to investigate these incidents where IEC officials were carrying special vote ballot boxes without a police escort. “Other than these four incidents, all voting stations opened on time and there have been no incidents,” said IEC provincial spokesperson, Sibusiso Nkosi. Nkosi could not say how long it would take the IEC to investigate these incidents. Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, concurred that voting was going smoothly at all voting stations.  “It’s been quiet, everything is smooth,” he said. Provincial Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) chairperson, Collen Sedibe, who is stationed in Emalahleni, said that voting was generally running peacefully and smooth in the province except one incident where three ANC supporters allegedly assaulted an EFF member in Kriel. Sedibe said that an EFF member was last week shot in Kriel when he was doing a door-to-door campaign. “A bullet was stuck in his neck … he is still in the intensive care unit in hospital,” he said. “In most places there have been no incidents. I can say voting has been running smoothly so far in the province.” Acting ANC provincial chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu, said that the party was happy with how the elections had gone so far. “I’ve heard of minor altercations here and there, but nothing serious came out of them … there have been no problems,” Ndlovu said. Mpumalanga premier, Refilwe Mtshweni, queued with the public and voted at Vosman in Emalahleni in the morning.
