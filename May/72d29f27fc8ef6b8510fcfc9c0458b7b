City Press
and the Modjadji family regret to announce the untimely death of senior
political journalist Ngwako Modjadji who died on Sunday morning. He was killed by a speeding motorist in a hit-and-run incident in Soweto. The
death was confirmed by his brother States Modjadji who had spent Saturday night
with Ngwako. Ngwako (40) had a national diploma in journalism from the Tshwane University of Technology.
He had worked at the Sowetan and Citizen newspapers, as well as Drum magazine
before joining City Press in 2018. City Press
editor Mondli Makhanya said the death of Ngwako was a sad loss for
journalism. “He was a
sharp journalist who spared nothing in getting a good story. He personified the
term ‘intrepid journalist’.  Just over
the weekend he joined former ANC president Jacob Zuma and ANC secretary-general
Ace Magashule on a door-to-door campaign in KwaZulu-Natal and managed to
interview the former president. “Above
all he was just a magnificent human being. A truly wonderful soul,” said
Makhanya. Ngwako is remembered by his
colleagues as a humble human being who always wore a smile, laughed generously
and was rarely ever seen upset. His family
said the funeral arrangements will be announced in due course.
