Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will institute review proceedings against the Public Protector’s report and findings, including the proposed remedial action, that she announced to the media today. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Gordhan guilty of “improper conduct” over his approval of then-deputy South African Revenue Services Commissioner Ivan Pillay’s early retirement and payout. She made the announcement at a media briefing on Friday afternoon. In a statement released on Friday night, Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji said that they believed that the Public Protector’s findings were “totally wrong both in fact and in law”. Malatji said that it didn’t seem as though their legal submissions to her office on May 22 were taken into account. In her remedial findings, Mkhwebane urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to take appropriate disciplinary action against Gordhan for violating the Constitution. She also said that steps needed to be taken to recover the money. In a six-page statement that she read out and shared with the media, Mkhwebane said that Gordhan should not have approved the early retirement with full pension benefits of Pillay in 2010 and his re-employment on a fixed term contract. Gordhan was finance minister at the time. Gordhan’s lawyer said Gordhan took issue “with both the haste and the timing of the release of her report. The complaint involves complex considerations of pension fund laws in as far they relate to public servants. It is doubtful whether due consideration was given to Minister Gordhan’ submissions”. Malatjie added that the haste and the timing of the Public Protector “shows a complete disregard for an important constitutional event for our country, the inauguration of the president of the Republic of South Africa”. 2019.05.22_ Public Protector_Section 7(9) Response Final (002) by CityPress on Scribd
