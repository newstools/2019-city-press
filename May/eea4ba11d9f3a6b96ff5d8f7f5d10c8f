ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile says raising funds for the party’s campaign leading up to Wednesday’s elections was a mammoth task. “Raising funds is always a challenge and elections by their very nature are expensive,” said Mashatile. There were many questions leading up to the May 8 national and provincial elections over the ANC’s lack of elections material, such as posters being distributed all over the country.

We will have to see when the results come out but I’m confident that we will do well,” said Mashatile. The former premier refused to entertain any questions from journalists with regards to the Alexandra renewal fund, which had a budget set aside in 2001 for more than R1 billion. Mashatile would have been the custodian of the fund during his tenure as premier from 2008 to 2009 and has been accused by the opposition EFF of misusing the funds. EFF leader Julius Malema has time and again insinuated that “Mashatile together with ANC activist Mike Maile should explain what happened to the R1.6 billion allocated to the Alexandra Renewal Project.” The ANC treasurer-general said “today was a day of reflecting and celebrating” the opportunity afforded to South Africans when the country got independence “I think throughout the campaign the ANC has been doing well and it’s a pity that I can’t campaign today and tell people to go in their numbers to vote ANC,” said Mashatile. The ANC treasurer-general cast his vote at Wendywood Secondary School in Sandton and was accompanied by Minister of Small Business Development Lindiwe Zulu.
