The ANC’s internal poll, released on Tuesday by the party’s Gauteng branch, has revealed that the ruling party will retain the province with a majority 56% of voters in next week’s election. “The polls are comprehensive and are unlike the propaganda being disseminated by other parties,” said Gauteng ANC head of elections, Lebogang Maile. He was making reference to the Democratic Alliance’s internal poll – which was leaked on the same day – showing the party closing the gap on the ANC. According to the ANC’s polls, the party will amass 56% of the votes in the province, the DA will get 17%, while the EFF will receive 11%. This was in direct contrast to the DA’s internal polls which showed the ANC at 44% – down from 48%; the DA at 38% – up from 34%; and the EFF getting 10% – down from 11%. The ANC poll clearly showed that the majority of the party’s votes will come from the African vote from whom they will get 61%, the DA 7% and the EFF 12%. According to Maile, these statistics were from “the same company that has been responsible for doing the party’s internal polls since 1994”. “In 2014 the same company told us that we were in trouble and we had to switch our strategy around and indeed things did not go well for us. This time around they are saying we will do well and we trust that this will be the case as we have for ourselves been experiencing the same optimism from our base on the ground,” said Maile. The internal poll – with a sample of 1826 voters and with a margin of error was 2.3% – found that 42% of those polled regarded the DA as racist, while 18% thought the EFF was racist. About 67% said they were disappointed in the ANC while 11% also indicated that they were disappointed with the DA. There are three other polls that have also recently released their national findings: Ipsos, MarkData and the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) – with the former at the higher end of the range for the ANC and the IRR at the lower end. Ipsos and MarkData believe the ANC could end up with between 59% and 61%, but the IRR was a full 10 percentage points lower putting the ruling party on 49.5% support nationally, and support increasing to 51% on a 72% voter turnout and 50% on a 69% voter turnout.
