Senior prosecutors at the National Prosecuting Authority, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi have been removed from office by President Cyril Ramaphosa, EWN reports. This came after retired Judge Yvonne Mokgoro, after a commission of inquiry into their fitness to hold office, found the pair “not fit and proper to hold their respective offices”. The inquiry, which was established in October last year, scrutinised the work done by the pair into several court cases including cases related to former president Jacob Zuma and former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen. Some of the scathing findings in the 140-page report drawn up by Mokgoro include a lack of accountability for the National Prosecuting Authority’s problems. Jiba, who was the deputy national director of public prosecutions, and Mrwebi, who was the special director of public prosecutions, were suspended in October, with Ramaphosa saying in letters to the pair that it was in the interest of the NPA’s image as a whole as well as the integrity of the commission to suspend them. The decision taken by Ramaphosa to fire the pair will now be sent to Parliament within the next two weeks, and Parliament will have 30 days to review the decision to either restore them to their positions or continue to enforce Ramaphosa’s decision. Earlier in the day, Ramaphosa - who was at an ANC rally in Butterworth, Eastern Cape - said that he had written to the two and would not reveal his decision until they were given ample time to read his letters.
