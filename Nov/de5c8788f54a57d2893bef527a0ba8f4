A couple who were mocked on social media over a marriage proposal at a KFC restaurant have now been showered with hundreds of thousands of rands worth of gifts, as well as a dream wedding. Hector Mkansi (28), who was unemployed for a long time, on Wednesday took Nonhlanhla Soldaat (28) to a KFC in the Vaal triangle. Somebody took a video of Mkansi popping the question to a very shy Soldaat halfway through their meal. Some Twitter users reacted snidely, such as a certain Anele, who said South African men clearly don’t have style. “Imagine somebody proposes to you at Kentucky Fried Chicken. I would walk out. Shame,” read her tweet. But the snide Twitter users were soon put in their place, with KFC launching a campaign to try to track the couple down. Within a few hours, scores of companies and individuals had come on board with KFC’s #StreetwiseWedding hashtag. Even KFC’s competitor, Chicken Licken, climbed in and said it didn’t want to “chicken out”, but a wedding actually required a cow – and it would donate two. Kulula.com promised a five-day honeymoon, and Standard Bank has offered to pay off any debt the couple has up to an amount of R300 000. Famous musicians offered to perform at their wedding and popular designers offered to make Soldaat’s dress. Woolworths threw in R15 000 worth of groceries, the V&A Waterfront offered a helicopter ride and Clicks gave R10 000. Nedbank even wants to give them a home loan and pay some of the costs. The list grew longer by the minute. Soldaat yesterday told City Press’ sister publication Rapport that she was overwhelmed and that the couple had asked someone to speak to the media on their behalf. The spokesperson said the pair weren’t sure if they wanted a second wedding, but said they were deeply touched by all the gestures. The couple met in 2010 and were married in 2012, but Mkansi could not afford an expensive ring. After saving up, they went to the KFC and he asked Soldaat to marry him for a second time. City Press
