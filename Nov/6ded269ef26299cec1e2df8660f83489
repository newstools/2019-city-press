The OR Tambo Special Economic Zone (SEZ) aims to develop land around OR Tambo International Airport to stimulate economic development through the use of the SEZ mechanism. The SEZ supports the growth of the beneficiation of precious metals and the minerals sector, with a focus on light, high-margin, export-oriented manufacturing of South African precious and semiprecious metals. The multi-site development consists of several industry-specific precincts and will be developed in phases over a 10- to 15-year period. The state-of-the-art In2Food Group factory is 22 708m² in size and is located on 3.5 hectares of land on the northern precinct of the OR Tambo SEZ and is fully operational already. The Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) played a major role in providing funding for the project. The prime location of the SEZ, which sits adjacent to the airport, places the In2Food Group at the heart of Africa’s best transport and logistics hub. Companies have access to significant investment incentives packaged at national government for investors and companies located in an SEZ. In2Food’s new plant has been developed to the quality specifications of Woolworths, which it has been supplying for more than 28 years. In2Food will also be exporting its products to markets such as the UK. The Gauteng Growth and Development Agency has made significant strides in attracting investments to the OR Tambo SEZ, primarily focused on the aviation, agroprocessing, jewellery, electronics and pharmaceutical industries. Skills development initiatives have been introduced to allow for broad participation by individuals and communities looking to take advantage of investment growth. “In the past five years, Gauteng attracted foreign direct investment to the tune of R199 billion and created more than 30 000 jobs,” said Gauteng Premier David Makhura during his 2019 budget speech.
