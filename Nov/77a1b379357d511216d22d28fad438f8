 AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has waived his right
to apply for temporary release from prison in order to attend the funeral of
AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu. The incarcerated traditional leader has told government that
he would rather not attend the funeral on Friday because he did not want to
cause a spectacle when the late royal is laid to rest. A number of public calls had been made for the king to be
granted the compassionate leave, including a strong push by the ANC in the
Amathole region, who called on President Cyril Ramaphosa and Justice and
Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola to intervene. Read: Ramaphosa feels the heat over Dalindyebo's early release The call was reportedly met with resistance from the Congress
of Traditional Leaders of SA who said it would not be proper for him to be
released only to be sent back to prison. He is serving a 12-year sentence for
three counts of arson, three counts of assault with intent to do grievous
bodily harm, one count of defeating the ends of justice and one count of
kidnapping. The king set fire to the homes of three of his subjects and
tenants, who he wanted evicted because he believed they had breached tribal
rules. Dalindyebo is still waiting for the outcome of his
application for a presidential pardon.
