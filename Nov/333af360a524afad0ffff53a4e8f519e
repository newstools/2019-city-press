The University of Cape Town (UCT) council has allegedly approved the appointment of Associate Professor Shose Kessi as the dean of humanities. City Press understands from reliable sources in the higher education sector, that Kessi’s appointment was approved on Friday following a special council sitting. Her appointment, sources said, was expected to be announced to the university community in due course. “Council has approved Kessi’s appointment,” said one source. Another source said the council had just rubber-stamped Kessi’s appointment as it was clear from the beginning that she would get the post. But, Elijah Moholola, UCT spokesperson, said on Saturday the recruitment process for the position was continuing. “Once all internal formal processes have been concluded, UCT will first communicate the outcome to the campus community before confirming the appointment in the media,” Moholo said. “All UCT senior appointments are first communicated internally after being formally concluded. As previously indicated, UCT recruitment processes are confidential. The university can therefore not publicly discuss details of this recruitment process.” Kessi has been the acting dean of humanities. She declined to comment and referred questions to UCT.
