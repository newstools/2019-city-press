Attempting to wrap events of the past 10 years seems almost an impossible task. City Press takes a trip down memory lane and remembers all of the notable things - some of the most iconic moments and memorable events - that have happened from 2010 through to 2019 From the 2010 World Cup spectacle in South Africa to Nelson Mandela’s death, there have been so many memorable events that have happened throughout the last decade.  There’s no denying that it has been a wild ride, especially for South Africans. Who can ever forget Siphiwe Tshabalala’s strike which opened the 2010 World Cup tournament – the first one on African soil? And the decade ended on a high with Zozibini Tunzi’s winning of the Miss Universe pageant and, you guessed it, Siya Kolisi lifting the Webb Ellis trophy in Japan.  But, it was not all rosy. The country also experienced the 2012 Marikana massacre in which 43 miners were killed in what would go down as one of the worst days in South African history.  Xenophobia dominated the headlines and so did anti-femicide movements, which spread virally on social media, and became a rallying cry for women as millions shared their own experiences of sexual harassment and sexual assault. And students’ voices were heard during the #FeesMustFall campaign.  The era of president Jacob Zuma gave us the Guptas and state capture. There was the Oscar Pistorius saga of murder, which shook the world. And there were many more notable times.
