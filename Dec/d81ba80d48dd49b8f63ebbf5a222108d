Pornhub has released its annual year in review, detailing what men and women were searching for and watching in 2019. “Black South African” was the top search by South Africans on Pornhub in 2019, followed by “Lesbian” and “Ebony.” Local visitors of the site spent an average of 11 minutes and 21 seconds viewing content, with 37% of that audience being women. Globally, the popular free porn site - the 45th most trafficked site on the internet - was visited 42 billion times at an average of 115 million visits per day. Searches for “Korean” remained the most popular, followed by “Japanese”, “black”, “daddy” and “straight”. Searches for “hentai” gained 5 positions, moving this genre into the top 10 gay searches for the first time. Searches that saw significant growth among gay men included “transgender” which grew by 121%, “femboy” by 99%, “furry” by 71% and “dominant” by 58%. Some of the top searches were questionable like “Alien” which is one of the more popular searches this year. While the appearance of “Amateur” shows an overall increased interest in seeing realistic portrayals of sex on the site. 23-year-old American pornographic actor Lana Rhoades was, by far, the most searched pornstar on Pornhub in 2019, jumping three spots from last year with 345 million video views, followed by Riley Reid and Mia Khalifa.
