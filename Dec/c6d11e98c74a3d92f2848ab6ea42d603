The EFF has forked out R32 million for its second national people’s assembly and that cost is set to rise over the next four days. EFF treasurer-general Leigh-Ann Mathys revealed the figure at a media briefing on Friday as the party’s elective conference got under way. Responding to questions from the media, Mathys said there was no VBS money used at the conference and the party did not have any external funders. Last year, an investigation by the Daily Maverick, revealed that EFF president Julius Malema and the EFF directly benefited from the VBS Mutual bank heist. The bank was placed under curatorship in 2018 evidence of wide-scale looting, fraud and corruption was found. “This NPA is really self funded. As you know we have now increased our seats in Parliament and also in all our legislatures, so our income is from the Electoral Commission (IEC), from Parliament and all our legislative budgets.” “We planned very well and budgeted well because we knew that this conference was coming,” said Mathys. She added that “at last count, having not done a final tally of the budget, it sits at R32 million,” most of which is being incurred in renting out the Nasrec venue and for transportation. EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee said the party had hired 76 buses to ferry delegates to the assembly. With 61 buses already having arrived, the party is expecting 10 more to arrive during the course of the day. In total, the party expects 3800 delegates to attend. According to Gardee the breakdown of the delegates expected to attend the conference is as follows: Western Cape 196, Northern Cape 156, Free State 236, North West 388, Mpumalanga 428, Eastern Cape 442, Limpopo 586, KwaZulu-Natal 532 and Gauteng 536. Gardee also said that 300 of those delegates will be made up of media and invited guests.
