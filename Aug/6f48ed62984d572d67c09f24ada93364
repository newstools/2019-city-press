It was the middle of 2001 in Bloemfontein when Mashudu Mathebula first watched fencing – it was a sport he didn’t even know existed. Right then, his passion for the sport was born. The 36-year-old Mathebula was introduced to the sport by his mother, who was a sports coordinator for the Soweto Sports Council at the time. In December of that year, the Soweto Fencing Club was formed. It was made up of five men – most of whom were Mathebula’s relatives – who trained at the Orlando Community Hall. Today, the club has more than 20 members ranging in age from eight to 36. Manyane Sefularo, a professional fencer and one of the club’s senior coaches, said: “It’s a small number if you compare it with the year it was formed. This is due mainly to a lack of publicity and sponsors. Many people got discouraged because the gear is expensive and none of it is locally manufactured – it is all imported.” Sefularo only started participating in the sport about 10 years ago. Together with nine other members of the club, he is attending high-performance training sessions at Walter Sisulu Hall in Randburg in preparation for the Limpopo Open Fencing competition next month. But like many other sporting codes in the country, a lack of funding and sponsorship have been the main challenges faced by the club. Transport to events and training sessions conducted outside the township also mean some aspiring participants miss out. The club has produced national champions since its inception, including Nomvula Mbatha and Aphiwe Tuku.
