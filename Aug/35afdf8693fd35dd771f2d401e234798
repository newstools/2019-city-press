She is a hard-core Marvel fan, was a Game of Thrones addict and enjoys eating out. That’s your new Miss South Africa, Zozibini Tunzi, a 25-year-old public relations student from the Eastern Cape. Tunzi was up against 15 other young women, and won the crown in a glittering affair at Time Square in Pretoria.   She took over the title from last year’s winner Tamaryn Green.   Tunzi, who is currently completing her BTech in PR in Cape Town, beat 15 other dazzling young women from across the country to scoop the prestigious crown. She walks away with R3 million in prize money and sponsorships deals. ?South Africa, meet your #MissSA2019 @zozitunzi – the Queen of the Nation. ??? ?Double tap and comment below with your well wishes as she wears her crown and begins her reign to represent us across the globe.? A post shared by  Miss South Africa (@official_misssa) on Aug 9, 2019 at 10:08am PDT  The runner-up, Sasha-Lee Olivier, takes home R250 000 in cash, and all 16 finalists receive R25 000. Tunzi is the first Miss South Africa to wear a brand new Ndebele-inspired crown. It weighs more than half a kilogram and is studded with 2 586 sparkling zirconia stones.  The Ndebele pattern at its core is a nod to the theme of this year’s Miss South Africa pageant: celebrating the beauty and diversity of African women. The crown has been named Ubuhle Bethungo Lenkosazana, which means “beauty of the rainbow” in isiZulu. • We already know from her official profile on the Miss SA website that she counts her parents among her heroes and would love to meet Caster Semenya. But to find out more about this beauty of the rainbow nation, get your copy of the City Press this Sunday.
