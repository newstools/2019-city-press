Here is a taste of some of the opinion pieces in this week’s Voices section. Is Cyril fit to govern? President Ramaphosa’s approach of tip-toeing on policy and avoiding conflict is putting his vision in a state of paralysis, writes Yonela Diko. Don’t remake Ramaphosa’s image Mcebisi Ndletyana says there is no reason to remake the president into something he is not. Doing so will create a fake and, because it is not based on either conviction or principle, a fake unravels. The result will be cynicism that will destroy his presidency. Let’s reintroduce ourselves as rebel women Feminist activist Philile Ntuli says the women’s movement across all spheres of the country has weakened. “We are non-threatening to the status quo and that needs to change.” Migration issue needs all hands Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi argues if we adopt a practice of political point-scoring, the country will not be able to resolve the problem of illegal migrants that is bedevilling the nation. Extract from Jonas' new book on State Capture Known as a politician who resisted state capture as a deputy minister of finance, Mcebisi Jonas has written a highly anticipated book called After Dawn. In an extract, which is the preface of the book, Jonas outlines why we find ourselves in this economic crisis and, more importantly, how we may it turn it around.
