Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams prevented an SABC reporter from filming a protest at the ANC’s provincial manifesto launch in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. Video aired by the SABC clearly showed a hand covering the lens of the camera as journalists tried to speak to the protesters. The hand in question belonged to Ndabeni-Abrahams, who later released an official statement apologising for her actions. According to SABC journalists at the launch, a group of protesters started singing and waving placards while ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile was delivering the keynote address. The journalists said they tried to interview the protesters, but Ndabeni-Abrahams put her hand over the camera lens.  In her official statement, she said: “I would like to offer my sincere apologies for an incident with some members of the media during a provincial rally in Mount Frere while trying to stop the singing comrades. I wish to assure the media and South Africans at large of my unreserved commitment to media freedom. I sincerely regret the incident.” The SA National Editors’ Forum has condemned Ndabeni-Abrahams’ actions
