Sports of national interest will see an increase in funding allocation from R821 million to R867 million before an estimated decrease in the 2020/2021 financial year to R834 million. This was after only R674 million was spent in the 2017/18 financial year, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced in his maiden budget speech on Wednesday afternoon. R11 million was allocated to major sporting events through the department of sports and recreation. Last year, R5.7 million was allocated for hosting identified major events in South Africa, and these events were used to showcase South Africa as a sport tourism destination of choice. Overall, R83 million has been allocated to developing and supporting elite athletes. Last year the sports and recreation department spent just under R12 million in advancing its relations with international bodies. In this budget, it has been allocated just under R5 million for the same. R155 million has been allocated to sport and recreation organisations, predominantly national federations, up from R149 million. Funding for transformation will also come from this allocation where the department intends to expand mechanisms to ensure recommendations from transformation audits are implemented. The department says it could use financial rewards as an incentive for federations to meet their transformation targets, while it would take non-financial punitive measures for those that fail to do so. The usual allocation of R12.8 million will also be transferred to Boxing South Africa. This came at the same time as cost-cutting measures have also been implemented by Cabinet. R15 million will be allocated to supporting and managing sporting and recreational infrastructure facilities, with the bulk of that going to making sure facilities are up to scratch. At the end of the day out of the main budget, sport and recreation will be allocated R1.1 billion, up from R1 billion.
