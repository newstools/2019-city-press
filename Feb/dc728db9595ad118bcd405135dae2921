The much-anticipated 2019 state of the nation address on Thursday gave politicians the opportunity to strut their stuff on the red carpet and showcase their fashion sense. One could argue that the movie Black Panther played a role in influencing many of the politicians’ wardrobe. And no, the politicians did not take a leaf off the country’s super rugby teams who last weekend donned tight fitting spandex like jerseys reminiscent of the regalia worn by superheroes as they took part in the #SuperHeroSunday. Instead, the majority of the politicians embodied the essence of the Black Panther movie by donning earthy tones or attire that partly or entirely incorporated African print fabrics that celebrated the country’s diverse cultures. Doeks, accessories, beads, and even walking sticks epitomised parliamentarians embracing the country’s diverse cultures. These colours and prints replaced last years’ prominent shades of red and gold, and the atmosphere on the red carpet was bright and cheerful. It got even more electric, when the Economic Freedom Fighters, graced the walkway in a sea of red as they donned their signature red overalls, red berets, head hats and domestic worker apparel.
