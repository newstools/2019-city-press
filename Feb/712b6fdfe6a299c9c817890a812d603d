On Thursday popular – and controversial – author Jackie Phamotse will release her new book, I Tweet What I Like ... So Sue Me. She describes the book, which follows her debut, Bare, as “educational”. It will be launched officially next month. Despite its racy title, the book deals with human trafficking, defamation, cyberbullying and social media policies. It was inspired by Phamotse’s own experiences after she was embroiled in a court battle with media and business personalities Basetsana and Romeo Kumalo. The Kumalos took Phamotse to court after she shared a series of tweets claiming there was “a sex tape involving the husband of a well-known media mogul with a younger rapper”. The court ordered her to write a public apology. “The court case gave me context of what I wanted to write about in my book,” said the former model and blessee.  The title was inspired by Steve Biko’s I Write What I Like, she said. “Social media is very powerful, yet we underestimate it. In the book I warn people to be responsible and vigilant about what they write on social media, without damaging people’s reputations,” she said, adding that her target audience was young people. When asked what lessons were learnt from the tweet that caused all the trouble, she said: “I apologise to everyone that I hurt.”
