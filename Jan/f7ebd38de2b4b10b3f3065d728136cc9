Retired Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt has so much faith in Wayde van Niekerk that he strongly believes the South African ace is capable of smashing the dust-gathering 200m world record. “Van Niekerk has shown and proved to be not only strong but fast.

I think the 100m record is going to stay for a very long time,” added the 32-year-old who set the standing 9.58 seconds in the 100m as well as the 19.19 seconds in the 200m at the 2009 IAAF World Championships.

We have done lots of events together because I like partying and celebrating.” • Read more in City Press newspaper on Sunday for the full interview
