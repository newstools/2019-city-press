Scores of prospective students queued outside universities this week hoping to be admitted at the last minute. Among them was Bonolo Mabokela (19), who was queuing outside the University of Johannesburg’s Kingsway campus on Tuesday. She said she had applied in April to study towards a degree in film and production, and was provisionally accepted pending the release of her matric results. Although Mabokela passed her matric at Noordwyk Secondary in Midrand last year, she fell short of two points to secure a place for her preferred degree. On Tuesday she was attempting to find out whether she could study towards a diploma instead. “I’m so desperate, I can study anything right now. I have already been accepted by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) but I’m still struggling to find a place. I could study for the same qualification at a private college, but Nsfas doesn’t fund students there,” she said. Mabokela said she wanted to study to succeed and help her family. At the University of Witwatersrand nearby, Tokologo Malatsi (18) had just heard that he had been accepted for a general Bachelor of Science degree. He applied in October but travelled to the university to verify whether he had been accepted or not. However, Malatsi was worried about whether he would be able to find money for registration. He had not applied to Nsfas because it was too late for him to do so. “It’s too early for me to celebrate. I’ve not registered yet,” he said. Malatsi said he hoped to receive a bursary. He woke up early to leave home in Burgersfort, Limpopo, so he could beat the queue. He had passed matric at his local St Thomas College. His first choice was to study towards a degree in engineering, but he had to start with a BSc qualification first to get there. “It’s tough out there. I need to get a good job,” Malatsi said.
