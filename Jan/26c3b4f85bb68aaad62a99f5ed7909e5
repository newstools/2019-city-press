Military officers in the west African country of Gabon staged an apparent coup during the early hours of Monday morning after seizing control of the state radio station and declaring their dissatisfaction with President Ali Bongo, who is recovering from a stroke in Morocco. A New Year’s eve address by Bongo “reinforced doubts about the president’s ability to continue to carry out the responsibilities of his office”, said Lieutenant Kelly Ondo Obiang, the leader of the self-declared Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon. The radio message was broadcast at around 4:30 a.m. local time. A source close to the government said there were gunshots around the national television station, but that the plotters appeared to be a small group of soldiers. On Monday morning, soldiers holding guns took over Gabon’s state television where one soldier read out a statement, saying that the military had seized control of the government “to restore democracy” to the country. In 2009 Bongo took over the presidency from his father, Omar, who died that year. The Bongo family has ruled the oil-producing country for more than half a century. In 2016, during his re-election, violent protests broke out amid claims of fraud. A spokesperson for the presidency told Reuters he would be making a statement shortly. - Additional reporting by Reuters
