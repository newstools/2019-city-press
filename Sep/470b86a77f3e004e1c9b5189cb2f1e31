Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has refuted allegations that have been circulating on social media, implicating judges in state capture and corruption. Mogoeng said the “faceless” sources who shared these claims need to reveal themselves, before there are any investigations into any wrong-doing. “It’s only an attack on the judiciary if there’s no evidence. That’s why I’m challenging them to make themselves and their proof known .... It would be most unfortunate to confront a colleague on allegations made by faceless people,” he said at a briefing held at his offices in Midrand. Mogoeng has asked the national police commissioner to unmask those behind allegations of corruption regarding the judiciary on social media. He mentioned those who do not use their own names to spread this information. “I have asked the secretary-general of the office of the chief justice, Memme Sejosengwe, to ask the national commissioner of police, General Kehla Sithole, to use all relevant capacities at his disposal to uncover the real forces behind the masks making apparently gratuitous allegations,” he said. The chief justice said he had still not found evidence of allegations that ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule had “captured” judges in the Free State High Court. “I have never received that information, I have been assured by all the provincial leaders of colleagues against whom the stabbing allegations of which corruption and capture have been made, that those allegations are false,” he said. A list of judges accused of wrong-doing was doing the rounds on social media. According to the posts the judges in question received money from President Cyril Ramaphosa’s “CR17 campaign” fund. The anonymous list was met with mixed reaction, with some calling for an investigation into the judiciary and others believing it was just a ploy to discredit the Ramaphosa and South Africa’s criminal justice system.
