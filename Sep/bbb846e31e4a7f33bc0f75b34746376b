Disgraced former communications minister Dina Pule is set for a big comeback in Mpumalanga politics after ANC members threw her hat into the ring as a contender for the position of provincial ANC chairperson. Pule’s name leads a slate that has current ANC deputy secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali (culture, sport and recreation MEC), secretary Mandla Ndlovu (acting ANC chairperson), as well as provincial executive members Pat Ngomana (finance MEC) and Vusi Shongwe (agriculture MEC). The slate suggests that Ntshalintshali should be deputy chairperson, Ndlovu should retain his position as secretary, while Ngomana and Shongwe should be deputy secretary and treasurer, respectively. Pule was fired from her ministerial post in 2013 after a damning Public Protector’s report found that she repeatedly lied and cheated to ensure that her boyfriend, Phosane Mngqibisa, benefited from state coffers. In 2014 she declined a nomination to the National Assembly. She was number 70 on the list. Also in the fray for the top job are Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, Peter Nyoni, Ndlovu and legislature member David Dube, according to slates under discussion by ANC members. Among the contenders, only Nyoni has announced his availability. The rest are testing the waters and lobbying underground. Dube’s slate has taken a unitary attitude of the various factions because it includes Mtshweni-Tsipane as deputy secretary, Ntshalintshali as deputy chairperson, Gert Sibande regional chairperson Muzi Chirwa as secretary and Nyoni as treasurer.
