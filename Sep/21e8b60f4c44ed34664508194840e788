City Press bagged several prestigious awards at the Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Awards this week. The event was held at The Venue Melrose Arch in Johannesburg on Thursday evening. Investigative journalist Sipho Masondo and former colleague Dewald van Rensburg won the journalist of the year and South African story of the year awards for breaking and having a series of stories on the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank. City Press photographer Rosetta Msimango won the upcoming/rising star award. City Press also won the Joel Mervis award for the best designed newspaper, which includes having pictures and graphics that punctuate the page boldly with eye contact and deep-etched shapes providing visual interest. Judges also said City Press’ printing production was excellent as colour pictures appear great in terms of ink coverage and enhancement. Typography and layout, the judges said, were well designed, lively and fun. Commenting on the journalist of the year award, the judges said: “Masondo and Van Rensburg broke the story of the collapse of the VBS Mutual Bank. Over many months, they stuck with the story, exposing the bank’s own executives and politicians’ involvement in the enrichment schemes that denuded the life savings of the rural poor of Limpopo.” Mondli Makhanya, City Press’ editor in chief, said: “This is testament to the hard work of City Press journalists, whose commitment to producing high quality print and digital products is second to none. “Day in and day out, week in and week out, this team dedicates itself to serving readers and all the people in our good republic with incisive and attractive journalism.”
