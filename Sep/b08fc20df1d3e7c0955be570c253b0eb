Comic Con Africa is the place to be if you are into cosplay and dressing up. This live-action art form is one of the best ways a fan can express their admiration and passion for the characters they love so dearly. With almost 40 000 people on the first two days of the second edition of Comic Con Africa, many fans dressed up. From masks to full ensemble outfits to family dress-ups and even mechnical wings that open up, fans are coming in droves to show off their amazing creations. The Comic Con Africa Championships of Cosplay also gives avid artists the chance to compete for the best in the land, with the winner heading to Chicago to represent Africa at the world championships. Last year the Africa winner was placed second in the world, proving that we do have amazing talent. Here are some of the cosplays on day one of Comic Con Africa, all shot by Rosetta Msimango.
