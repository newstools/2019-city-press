 Over the past few weeks we have witnessed another wave of public outrage in response to the levels of rape and femicide that have consumed South African society. Following the brutal rape and murder of 19-year old University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana, the killing of South African boxing champion Leighandre Jegels, and many more victims who have succumbed to untimely deaths as a result of gender based violence, calls for a national shutdown have been louder than ever before. City Press is responding to the urgent and powerful voices of South African women who are telling their stories through the hashtag #AmINext in various ways. One of them is by creating a platform called #WeWereNext to honour the victims of femicide and to help make sure that their deaths were not in vain. We wish to show the faces of these women, real people and not just statistics, and to share their stories and stories of the impact of their deaths on their families, loved ones and communities. So we are asking anyone impacted by femicide to join our campaign. If your loved one died at the hands of a man and you believe that their story should be told, please click on this submission page.   City Press
