Some of the opinion pieces in the Voices section this week Why are we so angry? Violence is born of our ever-festering collective psychosis. Curbing it requires us to face our colonialism-induced dysfunctional national identity, argues John Lamola. To spank a child or not Modidima Mannya says spanking children is not the only form of discipline. To simply identify the ban on spanking as the erosion of parental authority is rather self-serving. An Afrikaans-only university is a disgrace Just when a university is supposed to be a leveller in our society, an institution that closes the gap between rich and poor, should we unearth another form of racism by allowing an Afrikaans-only university?

Appeasing foreign interests at our expense What the president has done in going around the continent apologising on our behalf has undermined the mutual cooperation in the conduct of our affairs with other African countries.

Dangerous discourse No matter how inconvenient it may be for the state, foreign migrants are not the root cause of our troubles, write Jo Vearey and Gina Snyman.
